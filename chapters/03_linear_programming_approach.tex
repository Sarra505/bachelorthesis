This is the body
\section{Proposal}

\section{Experimental Design}
\subsection{Analysis of dataset properties}
In  this subsection we will conduct an analysis of our dataset properties. What are the 
particularites of the structure of these LP problems, is their any patterns in their solution
process. This anaylsis is based on observing the statistical results we obtained from
running different solvers on these problems. This will later provide us with insight 
regarding optimization of these problems.

\subsection{Dataset Structure}
Our dataset stucture: 
as opposed to what the linear programming research has dealt with, which is 
very large problems, we are dealing with hundreds of small problems. These are represented
in the revised simplex algorithm by
sparse matrices but not as sparse as it would have been if the problem was large, 
small matrices that are not small enough to be dense. 
(they still have quite a number of non-zeroes).
