The quality of cardinality estimates is critical for query optimization.
Research has 
shown that cardinality estimation is the major root of many issues in 
query optimization, which is why pessimistic cardinality estimators, that
anticipate worst-case outcomes, can be very useful.
A way to estimate reliable
upper bounds of query sizes is through linear programming.
Our aim with this project is to implement, 
investigate and compare different methods suitable for solving small linear programming (LP) problems.
We investigate packing LP problems taken from cardinality estimation benchmarks and solve them 
with different algorithms.
This should guide us into constructing a thorough analysis of the particularities of
these LP problems, what's unique about their structure and if their solution
process follows any patterns. We then discuss and draw hypotheses on the ways this 
analysis can be exploited to make a recommendation regarding the solution process: which methods or combination of methods deliver the best time and memory complexity.
