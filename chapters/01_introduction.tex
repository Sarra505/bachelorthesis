\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}
In this chapter we motivate the purpouse of our research and present an overview of its structure, highlighting the importance of  reliable cardinality estimation in the field of query optimization. Our contribution's relevance lies in selecting the best method or combination of methods to solve hundreds of small LP problems efficiently, optimizing for time and memory. Cardinality estimation problem can be solved using linear programming, so our research opens doors for a faster cardinality estimation, and, in turn, efficient query execution.

\section{Motivation}

The quest for optimizing query execution in databases is a critical
challenge. The query optimizer attempts 
to determine the most efficient way to execute a given query by considering the possible 
query plans \parencite{leis2018query}. 
These plans are all equivalent in their final output, but vary in their
cost, that is, the amount of time that they need to run.
Cost-based query optimizers select query plans that have the lowest estimated cost to
execute. One parameter that plays an important role in this selection process 
is the cardinality estimates 
of these plans. Therefore, improving cardinality estimation leads to better estimated costs 
and, in turn, faster execution plans \parencite{graefe1993volcano}.
Linear Programming (LP) is a mathematical modeling technique to calculate the optimum of a linear function
given a set of linear constraits \parencite{chvatal1983linear}.
Cardinality estimation can be represented through linear programming \parencite{atserias2013size}.
Our aim with this project is to implement, 
investigate and compare different methods suitable for solving hundreds of small LP 
problems. These methods include the standard simplex algorithm and the revised simplex algorithm.
 We test our methods alongside Umbra's cardinality estimator, which uses revised simplex algorithm
with MPFI \parencite{neumann2020umbra}. 
By running various benchmarks, we conduct an analysis on the structure of these LP problems,
we compare the time profiles for the different methods tested and finally 
make a recommendation on the methods or combination of methods that deliver the best time and memory 
complexity.

\section{Chapter Overview}

This thesis is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chapter 2: Background and Related Work} - Provides a 
  foundational understanding of linear programming, duality, 
  and an overview of the different LP solvers. We also explore cardinality
   estimation and state-of-the-art LP solvers.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 3: Tuning Linear Programming Solvers for Query
   Optimization} - Introduces our proposal and implementation, 
   including the hierarchy, tableau simplex solver, data structures, 
   revised simplex solver, and stability considerations.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 4: Evaluation} - Presents our results. Starting by 
  an in-depth analysis 
  of our results, including the analysis of the query dataset, and the
   randomly generated LPs.
   We also discuss limitations and outline potential future work.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 5: Conclusion} - Summarizes our findings 
  and contributions, reiterating the importance of cardinality estimation 
  in query optimization, and discusses the implications of our research.
\end{itemize}

Throughout this thesis, we aim to provide a comprehensive 
examination of the cardinality estimation problem and the methods 
to solve it using linear programming. Our ultimate goal is to contribute 
valuable insights that can enhance the time and memory complexity of the 
query optimization process.
