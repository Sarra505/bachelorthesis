The quality of cardinality estimates is critical for query optimization. Research has 
shown that cardinality estimation is the major root of many issues in 
query optimization, which is why pessimistic cardinality estimators, that
anticipate worst-case outcomes, can be very useful.
A way to estimate reliable
upper bounds of query sizes is through linear programming (LP).
Recognizing this, our project aims to implement and compare different methods suitable for solving small LP problems.
We investigate packing LP problems taken from cardinality estimation benchmarks.
This should guide us into constructing a thorough analysis of the particularities of
these LP problems, what is unique about their structure and if their solution
process follows any patterns. In analysing our findings, we aspire to present insights that could inform recommendations on the most efficient solution methods, optimizing for time performance.
